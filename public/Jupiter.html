            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Jupiter's signature stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, 
                floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. The dark orange stripes are called belts, while 
                the lighter bands are called zones, and they flow east and west in opposite directions. 
                Jupiterâ€™s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.
                With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size 
                of a grape, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.Jupiter took shape along with rest of the solar system 
                about 4.5 billion years ago. Gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this gas giant.
