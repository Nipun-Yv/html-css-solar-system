            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and it's the third largest planet in our solar system – about four times wider than Earth. The diameter at its equator is 31,763 miles (51,120 kilometers).
                Uranus is a very cold and windy planet. It is surrounded by faint rings, and more than two dozen small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side.
                Uranus is blue-green in color due to large amounts of methane, which absorbs red light but allows blues to be reflected back into space. The atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, but also includes large amounts of water, ammonia and methane.

            <h3>Extemely Tilted Axis</h3>
            <p>
                Uranus has an extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees, causing it to rotate on its side

            <h3>The Coldest Planet</h3>
            <p>
                Despite being closer to the Sun than Neptune, Uranus has the coldest planetary atmosphere, with temperatures dropping to -224°C (-371°F).

            <h3>The Faintest Rings</h3>
            <p>
                Uranus has a system of faint rings, discovered in 1977, which are made primarily of dark, narrow bands of particles.

            <h3>Methane Atmosphere</h3>
            <p>
                The presence of methane in Uranus's atmosphere gives the planet its distinctive blue-green color.
