            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and the sixth largest planet. It’s the hottest planet in our solar system.
 Our nearest planetary neighbor, the second planet from the Sun, has a surface hot enough to melt lead. The atmosphere is so thick that, from the surface, the Sun is just a smear of light.
In some ways it is more an opposite of Earth than a twin: Venus spins backward, has a day longer than its year.It might once have been a habitable ocean world, like Earth, but that was at least a billion years ago. A runaway greenhouse effect turned all surface water into vapor,
 which then leaked slowly into space. The present-day surface of volcanic rock is blasted by high temperatures and pressures. Asked if the surface of Venus is likely to be life-bearing today, we can give a quick answer: a hard “no.”

            <h3>Hottest Planet in the Solar System:</h3>
            <p>
                Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures around 900°F (475°C) 
                due to a thick, CO₂-rich atmosphere and runaway greenhouse effect.

            <h3>Retrograde Rotation:</h3>
            <p>
                Venus rotates backwards compared to most planets, causing the Sun to rise in the west 
                and set in the east. It takes 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, longer than its 225-day year.

            <h3>Crushing Pressure: </h3>
            <p>
                The surface pressure on Venus is 92 times that of Earth,
                 equivalent to being 900 meters underwater, which destroys landers in a few hours.

            <h3>Extreme Volcanic Terrain:</h3>
            <p>
                Venus has more volcanoes than any other planet,
                 with over 1,600 major volcanic features, although many are likely inactive.
