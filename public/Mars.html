            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and bitter cold. T
                he fourth planet from the Sun, Mars, is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other). 
                Mars is one of the easiest planets to spot in the night sky – it looks like a bright red point of light.
                Despite being inhospitable to humans, robotic explorers – like NASA's Perseverance rover – are serving as 
                pathfinders to eventually get humans to the surface of the Red Planet.Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to explore the alien landscape. NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, 
                with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.

            <h3>Red Planet</h3>
            <p>
                Mars is known as the Red Planet due to its iron oxide-rich surface, 
                giving it a reddish appearance.

            <p>
                Mars is home to Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system,
                 standing about 13.6 miles (22 kilometers) high.

            <h3>Thin Atmosphere</h3>
            <p>
                Mars has a thin atmosphere, composed mostly of carbon dioxide, 
                with surface pressure less than 1% of Earth's.

            <h3>Evidence of Water</h3>
            <p>
                Mars shows signs of ancient river valleys,
                 lake beds, and minerals that form in water, indicating 
                 it once had liquid water on its surface.
