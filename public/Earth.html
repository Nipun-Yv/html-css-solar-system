            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. 
                Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
                Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here. Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the temperature 
                allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.
Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are changing due to the ongoing effects of climate change.

            <h3>Plate Tectonics (Crust)</h3>
            <p>
                Earth’s surface is divided into tectonic plates, 
                whose movements cause earthquakes, and mountain formation.

            <h3>Oxygen-Rich Atmosphere:</h3>
            <p>
                Earth's atmosphere contains 21% 
                oxygen, essential for the survival of most life forms.
